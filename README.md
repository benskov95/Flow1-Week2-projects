# Flow1-Week2-projects

## Note
There is no Monday and Thursday folder because:
1) We did code reviews on Monday, so no projects there.
2) Thursday was all about configuring nginx on our droplet and creating a secure (HTTPS) connection for our domain. Also spent some time getting a better understanding of encryption and certificates, like how they work and why we need them to ensure that our domain is trustworthy and safe.

## Tuesday
No projects, worked on answering questions related to TCP/IP and HTTP in the 'Fundamental Network Topics' Word file.

## Wednesday
Worked on 2 projects: 'http_protocol' and 'sessions'. Both of these projects were part of an exercise involving HTTP and specifically the various headers that get sent with requests/responses and how we can observe them with our browser's Developer Tools. This was the main focus of the first project, 'http_protocol', while 'sessions' was more about understanding how we can achieve statefulness on our server despite HTTP inherently being stateless (meaning that by default a server will not recognize and remember the same user, even if that user sends two requests in short succession).

The exercise involving the 2 projects also came with a list of questions, all of which have been answered in the 'The HTTP Protocol' Word file.

#### Project status
- 'http_protocol' = completed
- 'sessions' = completed

## Friday
Worked on 1 project: 'link_page'. This project was not a direct part of any exercise, and was made only to host a page with the various links that we were asked to provide for our weekly hand-in for week 2.

#### Project status
- 'link_page' = completed
